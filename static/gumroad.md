### üñåÔ∏è **Visual & UI Design Style**

| Element             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Typography**      | Large, clear fonts (usually sans-serif, like Inter or Helvetica); generous line spacing; emphasis on readability.                                                                                                      |
| **Colors**          | Soft, neutral backgrounds (white or light gray), bold accents (purple, black, or pastel tones depending on product branding). The older Gumroad used colorful gradients, but newer designs lean more muted and mature. |
| **Layout**          | Clean grid layouts with a lot of **white space**. Emphasis on clarity and scannability. Cards and sections are often centered and neatly stacked.                                                                      |
| **Buttons**         | Rounded corners, solid fill or outlined styles; hover states are subtle.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Imagery**         | Creator-focused: minimal images or large, bold product mockups. Pages are often **text-heavy** with clear CTAs (call-to-actions).                                                                                      |
| **Animations**      | Very subtle; primarily for interactive elements like form fields and buttons.                                                                                                                                          |
| **Mobile-Friendly** | Fully responsive, clean layouts adapt well on mobile. Prioritizes readability and tap-friendly buttons.                                                                                                                |
